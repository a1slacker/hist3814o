**What annotation stuck out to me and why?**
>these are the real questions

To be honest, I'm still unsure about alot surrounding this topic of annotations. How can one annotation be made interesting and such? (*even searched interesting annotations on the [world wide web](http://fivecoolthings.blogspot.ca/search/label/)*) Though i found some examples that opened my eyes to how some annotations can be used, this still did not help in providing an answer for this exercise.

>in order to do this, i  had to follow some steps:
* first I had to go to the [getting started](http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/) section of the class work book where I knew annotations were.
* Secondly, i had to scroll through all the annotations on the page (*made easy through hypothosis*).

In my search I did manage to come across an annotation that  grab my attention. This annotation was done by [Jack Blackadar](https://hyp.is/Fb7-dmK7EeeiadsuRIhoig/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/). The reason i found it interesting, the fact it stood out to me, is because it contain aspects I, at the time did know it could. He embedded code into his annotation in the text. This embedded code looked different from the rest of the writting in the annotation, that is also how it caught my eye.

All in all, that just as much sums of my interesting encounter.
